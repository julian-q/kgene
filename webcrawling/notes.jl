{"title": "Ride of a Lifetime", "contents": "\u201cMaybe that is the case for many of us: No matter who we become or what we accomplish, we still feel that we\u2019re essentially the kid we were at some simpler time long ago. Somehow that\u2019s the trick of leadership, too, I think, to hold onto that awareness of yourself even as the world tells you how powerful and important you are\u2026wherever you are along the path, you\u2019re the same person you\u2019ve always been.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been getting lots of recommendations for\u00a0\nThe Ride of a Lifetime\n, and I\u2019m happy to say that it does live up to all the hype. However, it's been nearly a month since I\u2019ve finished this book, and I start school today. I\u2019ve unfortunately lost motivation for fleshing out this review, so here\u2019s a hasty attempt at doing this book justice.\nBen Smith described this book\u00a0\nin the New York Times\n\u00a0as a \u201cself-hagiography,\u201d but I did not find this book self-aggrandizing by any means. Iger is a brilliant storyteller; he also had an incredible run at Disney \u2014 starting as a production assistant at ABC, rising humbly through the\u00a0\ncursus honorum\n\u00a0to the helm. He was part of the mergers of ABC and Cap Cities, then ABC and Disney; he led the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Fox, transforming Disney into a 21st century media conglomerate. According to this article from CNBC, Disney made\u00a0\nmore than $33.8 billion\n\u00a0at the global box office from the first three acquisitions alone.\nBut what I admire most about Iger is not his business acumen, which even\u00a0\nBill Gates\n\u00a0has praised him for. Rather, it is the integrity and humility with which Iger treats the people around him. When Iger made acquisitions, he laid out what he wanted and approached his business partners with immense respect and empathy. I learned a lot about what it means to be a principled business leader - values matter most. Unlike Jordan Peterson\u2019s\u00a0\n12 Rules for Life\n\u00a0or Ray Dalio\u2019s\n\u00a0Principles\n\u00a0(neither of which I have been able to get through yet), this book felt effective because it encapsulates values into a narrative, and it gave me so much clarity about my own life.\nIger led Disney into the 21st century by embracing creative change \u2014 and not standing in opposition. Here were the most memorable episodes for me:\nworking with Steve Jobs to put ABC TV shows like Lost and Desperate Housewives on iPods\nacquiring Pixar rather than trying to revitalize Disney Animation; key breakthrough was when Iger realized that all the character he saw in a parade at Hong Kong Disneyland had no Disney characters from the last ten years\nincurring losses and undercutting Disney\u2019s transitional business to build Disney+ and acquire a majority stake in Hulu, a strategic move that has helped Disney retain its footing in a post-pandemic world\nThere definitely was a familiar cast of characters in this book: Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Steve Jobs, Rupert Murdoch, Jeffrey Katzenberg. One of the parts I loved most about this book was comparing my notes about the Pixar acquisition from Walter Isaacson\u2019s\u00a0\nSteve Jobs\n. Sometimes it scares me how the world becomes smaller as you become more accomplished.\nRelationships, personal or professional, can be tough to navigate, but Iger showed me that communicating with empathy and transparency goes a long way. Iger managed to build a lasting business partnership and friendship with one of the most obtuse (and brilliant) people in the world in part because he had great character and values.\n\u201cI\u2019ve generally tried over the years to keep my eye on the job I have and not the jobs I might someday have.\u201d\nIger wrote about how some people he worked with \u201clet ambition get too far ahead of opportunity\u201d - they didn\u2019t tend enough to their current responsibilities because they were so focused on where they would rather be.\nHere is his advice: \u201cDo the job you have well; be patient; look for opportunities to pitch in and expand and grow; and make yourself one of the people, through attitude and energy and focus, that your bosses feel they have to turbot when an opportunity arises\u2026 [prove yourself] to be indispensable day in and day out.\u201d\nI\u2019m so happy and grateful to be a full-time student. It\u2019s something I try to remind myself of every day. One of my goals for this coming quarter is to focus more on opportunities at my university, rather than clubs and professional fellowships. I need to remember what I\u2019m here for in the first place: my education.\nI remember reading this excerpt on Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld\u2019s blog many years back, when I did not yet relate to the feeling of the panoply of choice (and ensuing panic) at top universities.\nWhat I only have four years to do is ponder Buddhist scriptures with the world\u2019s leading experts. Knowing myself, if I don\u2019t read Proust or Nietzsche in college, it\u2019s possible that I never will (and certainly not with the same depth as I would here). Some people have the time, curiosity, and motivation to teach themselves the intricacies of string theory or Keynesian economics; I salute them. But most of us will get caught up in our real-world lives, putting off our intellectual bucket lists until we inevitably tell our children and grandchildren that we \u201cwish we had read more.\u201d\nSo, students of the moment: let\u2019s do less. But let\u2019s use our free time and psychological space to delve into learning. To do otherwise belittles both our education and our extracurricular pursuits. Study because you\u2019re fascinated. Explore activities because you love them. Everything else is just glamorous clutter \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to clear the way for what really counts.\nSo here\u2019s to 2021 - a year for doing less and thinking more.\nstudiis florentem ignobilis oti\n.\nGratitude\n: \u201cI told him how much I appreciated everything that he and my mom had done for us, the ethics they instilled, and the love they gave us. I told him that was enough, more than enough, and wished that my gratitude might liberate him in some small way from disappointment.\u201d\nInflection points\n: \u201cThere are moments in our careers, in our lives, that are inflection points, but they\u2019re often not the most obvious or dramatic ones. I wasn\u2019t sure I was making the right decision. It was probably the safer one, really, to stay at the place I knew. But I also didn\u2019t want to leave too impulsively, because my ego had been bruised or because I had some feeling of superiority when it came to Dennis. If I was ultimately going to leave, it had to be because there was an opportunity that was too great to say no, and the ICM job wasn\u2019t that.\u201d\nOn owning mistakes\n: \u201cYou can\u2019t erase your mistakes or pin your bad decisions on someone else. You have to own your own failures. You earn as much respect and goodwill by standing by someone in the wake of failure as you do by giving them credit for a success.\u201d\nHow to (not) be barbarians at the gate\n\u00a0(Disney\u2019s Cap Cities acquisition): \u201cThey had also never acquired a big company before, and they\u2019d given very little thought as to how to do it with sensitive and care. Disagreements that could have been handled with diplomacy were instead done with a tone that was often authoritative and demanding. They acted as if, because they\u2019d bought us, we were exited always to bend to their will.\u201d\nWhen in doubt, ask the hard questions\n: \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem I need to solve? Does this solution make sense? If I\u2019m feeling some doubt, why? Am I doing this for sound reasons or am I motivated by something personal?\u201d\nTreat people with empathy and respect: \u201c\nDon\u2019t let your ego get in the way of making the best possible decision.\u201d\nHow to be a great manager:\nBe values-driven\n: \u201cI learned from [Tom and Dan] that genuine decency and professional competitiveness weren\u2019t mutually exclusive. In fact, true integrity \u2014 a sense of knowing who you are and being guided by your own clear sense of right and wrong \u2014 is a kind of secret weapon.\u201d\nRespect others\u2019 time\n: \u201cManaging your own time and respecting other\u2019s time is one of the most vital things to do as a manager.\u201d Try your best to avoid canceling, rescheduling, or abbreviating meetings.\nLearn and absorb\n: \u201cYou have to hear out other people\u2019s problems and help find solutions.\u201d\nGive compassionate feedback\n\u00a0(Iger to Coogler on\u00a0\nBlack Panther\n): \u201cYou\u2019ve created a very special film. I have some specific notes, but before I give them to you, I want you to know we have tremendous faith in you.\u201d; \u201cEmpathy is a prerequisite to the sound management of creativity, and respect is critical.\u201d\nBe humble\n: \u201cThe first rule is not to fake anything. You have to be humble, and you can\u2019t pretend to be someone you\u2019re not or to know something you don\u2019t. You\u2019re also in a position of leadership, though, so you can\u2019t let humility prevent you from leading\u2026You have to ask the questions you need to ask, admit without apology what you don\u2019t understand, and do the work to learn what you need to learn as quickly as you can. There\u2019s nothing less confidence-inspiring than a person faking a knowledge they don\u2019t possess. True authority and true leadership come from knowing who you are and not pretending to be anything else.\u201d This is the kind of second lieutenant I want to be.\nSun Valley, Idaho - where the Allen and Company conference happens every year (and where all the\u00a0\nVC Patagonia vest memes\n\u00a0come from); really interesting to see this coastal enclave in the middle of nowhere. It truly is a hotbed for mega deals.\non the Cap Cities acquisition: \u201cI was standing in a parking lot talking with Tom, and I could see Warren Buffett, our largest shareholder, and Michael Eisner talking nearby\u2026A few weeks later, Michael reached out to Tom formally to begin the negation for Disney to buy Capital Cities/ABC.\u201d\nfrom Stephen Schwartzman\u2019s book: \u201cBack in the United States after the Bolsheviks had seized most of the US-funded assets, [J. Press Harriman] came up with the idea for a ski resort in Idaho modeled on St. Moritz in Switzerland. He called it Sun Valley.\u201d\nClay Christensen\u2019s\u00a0\nThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\nIger on convincing the Disney board to invest in Disney+: \u201cThere\u2019s even you, a board that doesn\u2019t know how to grant stock because there\u2019s only one way we\u2019ve ever done it. It\u2019s your choice. Do you want to fall prey to the \u2018innovator\u2019s dilemma\u2019 or do you want to fight it?\u201d\nIf tradition generates friction, would a place with no tradition be more innovative, no? It certainly would be more open to change.\n"}
{"title": "Secrets of Sand Hill Road", "contents": "Secrets of Sand Hill Road\u00a0\nis one of the OG books of venture capital; I see it on nearly every recommended reading list. Overall, I thought it was OK. I found many of the explanations are long-winded and confusing. The two-minute video I watched on SAFEs, discounts, and valuation caps was so much better than the first half of chapter 9.\nThat said, this book is great for founders because it provides a very comprehensive overview of how VC works. Kupor clearly targets entrepreneurs in his writing by offering very clear advice on how to approach negotiations and walking through the term sheet; throughout the book, his legal expertise as a startup lawyer definitely shone through. I loved reading about In Re Trados, Carsanaro v. Bloodhound Technologies, and Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc.\nI also think\u00a0\nSOSHR\n\u00a0might be better used as a reference book. This book took me more than two months to get through, in part because it was so definition-heavy. You might be better served by just looking up concepts and terms you are interested in learning more about.\nThese are not main ideas, but just some thoughts I had as I was reading.\nFounders must be able to tell stories in a compelling way, to articulate a vision that makes employees, customers, and venture capitalists want to invest. It helps when startups have organic founder-market fit: when \u201cthe solution was derived from a personal experience of hardship, around which the entrepreneur felt compelled to build a company.\u201d\nGreat founders tie their personal stories, experiences, and earned secrets into their founding vision for a company. They help investors see that their company will not only be a leader in its market but perhaps also in markets that do not yet exist.\nOne example: employee stock options are vested over time; typically, these options have a post-termination exercise period of ninety days. However, if the stock prices for the company appreciate significantly, employees may not be able to exercise their options (the out-of-pocket amounts can be huge and thus prohibitively expensive for many employees), especially since many startup employees take cash pay cuts in exchange for equity options. In a sense, these employees are \u201cpunished\u201d for their success.\nAnother example: An investor should always act in the best interest of the company and of the shareholders. At the same time, she also has duties to her LPs. In the case of In Re Trados, three of the directors represent VC firms that are part of the $57.9 million in liquidation preference. Because of their liquidation preference, these VCs gain less from increases in the values of the company and are not incentivized to push up the price, whereas common shareholders receive additional upside.\nMany VCs have experience as operators themselves; others have invested in numerous startups. Beyond financial backing, VCs can provide startup founders with guidance, support, and a network of relationships. VCs can also provide coaching in areas in which they have demonstrated expertise. Nevertheless:\nGood VCs recognize that, ultimately, it is the entrepreneurs and the employees who build iconic companies, with hopefully a little bit of good advice and prodding sprinkled in along the way by their VC partners.\nHere\u2019s why:\nA Delaware C corp has a \u201cnon-passthrough\u201d structure. Rather than distributing profits directly to owners, as a partnership would, Delaware C startups can reinvest those profits. Thus, it is good for companies that are focused on building long-term equity value in the business versus distributing profits directly to shareholders.\nA C corp makes it easier to grant equity to employees. There is no limit on the number of shareholders that can be part of the organization; thus, as a startup hopefully grows, later employees can also benefit from potential equity ownership.\nA C corp allows for different classes of shareholders with different rights. This is good for VCs, who want to invest in \u201cpreferred stock.\u201d\nMany LPs of venture firms, such as endowments and foundations, are tax-free. Under US tax laws, pass-through entities (e.g., partnerships or limited liability companies) can cause even tax-free entities to have to pay tax on what is called \u201cunrelated business income.\u201d (UBIT) If GPs invest in pass-through entities, they can therefore create this potential tax risk for LPs; investing in C corps raises no such issues.\nBill Campbell - \u201cBill is a Silicon Valley legend - Apple, Intuit, GO Corporation, Google, etc. - and in his later years was referred to as \u2018Coach.\u2019 for he spent tireless hours coaching entrepreneurs as they were building their businesses.\u201d\n\u201cYC created true communities of entrepreneurs among which they could share their knowledge and views both on company building and on their experiences working with VC firms.\u201d\n"}
{"title": "What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence", "contents": "First book I\u2019ve finished since school started, yay! My brain is a bit too fried to write three main ideas, though I might come back later.\nOverall, I loved reading about how Schwarzman went from growing up in very modest circumstances in suburban Philly to managing one of the largest investment management firms in the world, and I thoroughly enjoyed following his journey.\nI think his biggest strengths are the following:\nwillingness to challenge the status quo\n, whether as a hedge fund manager during the 2008 financial crisis (got rid of vulnerable real estate holdings, raised fund in advance), a young officer in the Army, or an undergrad advocating for parietals\nchutzpah\n\u00a0- his story about getting ballerinas to perform at Yale as his entry into Skulls and Bones will always stay in mind; so impressed by his ingenuity.\nintegrity\n\u00a0and strong relationships - connected to the biggest names in business and politics (Kennedy Center, China)\nability to\u00a0\nsynthesize ideas\n\u00a0- I loved how Schwarzman described himself as \u201ca telephone switchboard filled with inputs.\u201d\npersistence\n\u00a0- finishing the last leg of a relay with a torn hamstring, standing in the rain with Pete when raising Blackstone\u2019s first fund\nI never thought I would become interested in leveraged buyouts, but I really loved this book. If there is anything that I took away, it would be the assurance that I do not need to have grown up on the Upper East Side to live there as an adult. My drive, persistence, and kindness will take me far. I have the right to be in every room.\nIf the son of a curtain store owner can become the head of the largest alternative investment firm in the world, I can, too.\nPrinciples\n\u00a0by Ray Dalio (they\u2019re friends!)\nThings:\nLeveraged buyouts (like remodeling a house and selling it)\nan investor buys a company by borrowing money (putting up equity), delisting if public, paying interest on the debt with the company\u2019s cash flow while remaking improvements, and reselling (or going public) at a higher price\nbut then there\u2019s the other side, too:\nWe are in the business of buying, fixing, and selling. We are managers and owners as much as we are investors. We try to improve the companies we buy and help them grow faster. The faster a company grows, the more someone else will pay for it. The perceived problems arise when we buy a company that is poorly managed and we have to fire people to make room for better ones, or change strategy. Even once we\u2019ve improved the company, grown it, and hired more people than it ever had before, the people we fired tend to stay angry at us and become our critics.\nMergers and acquisitions\nPeople:\nRuth Porat, Google\u2019s chief financial officer\nKathleen McCarthy, senior managing director @ Blackstone (real estate)\nOops, there were a lot.\nBusiness\nBusiness is about people.\nPeople who are 10s sense problems, design solutions, and take the business in new directions without being told to do so. Tens always make it rain.\nWall Street and business are small worlds. If you start at a great school or a big firm, crossing paths with the best people of your generation, you\u2019ll keep running into them. (Yale, Harvard Business School, the Army Reserves, Wall Street)\nChoose hard problems to solve.\nIf you\u2019re going to dedicate your life to a business, which is the only way it will ever work, you should choose one with the potential to be huge.\nThe harder the problem, the more limited the competition; people with tough problems will seek you out and pay you handsomely to solve them. (What Ben Horowitz said, too)\nThree litmus tests for business idea: potential to be huge, value add / earned secret (when people see what you are offering, they should say to themselves, \u201cMy gosh, I need this. I\u2019ve been waiting for this\u201d), timing\nStrengths and Values\nSell well.\nDon\u2019t just try selling what is that you want to sell. Listen. Wait to hear what people want, what is on their mind, and set about making it happen. Pay very close attention to what the other person is saying and the way he or she is saying it.\nFind some point of connection, an area of common ground, a shared interest or experience that turns a professional encounter into a more personal one.\nPersist.\nAs a salesman, I\u2019d learned you can\u2019t just pitch once and be done. Just because you believe in something doesn\u2019t guarantee anyone else will. You\u2019ve got to sell your vision over and over again.\nWhen people ask me how I succeed, my basic answer is always the same: I see a unique opportunity, and I go for it with everything I have. And I never give up.\nTo be successful you have to put yourself in situations and places you have no right being in. You shake your head and learn from your own stupidity. But through sheer will, you wear the world down, and it gives you what you want. The money had to be out there.\nListen to the discordant notes and the tunes you are hearing; be most active and flexible, and welcome uncertainty.\nBest way to persist is to devote time and energy to the things you enjoy. \u201cExcellence follows enthusiasm, and doing anything solely for prestige rarely leads to success. If you have passion for pursuing your dreams; if you persevere; and if you are committed to helping others, you will have a full and consequential life and always have a chance at greatness. And the benefit of your enormous gifts will accrue to yourself, the people you love, and to society at large.\u201d\nSynthesize ideas.\nWhen you\u2019re presenting yourself, the whole picture has to make sense, the entire, integrated approach that gives other people cues and clues as to who you are\nAbsorb information, study your own experiences, learn from your mistakes, and evolve.\nIf you ever felt overwhelmed by work, I said, pass on some of your work to others. It might not feel natural. High achievers tend to want to volunteer for more responsibility, not give up some of what they have taken on. But all that anyone higher up in the firm cares about is that the work is done well. There is nothing heroic or commendable about taking on too much and then screwing it up.\nEverything in business relates to everything else. For a business to succeed, each part has to work on its own and with all the other parts. It\u2019s a closed, integrated system, organized by managers. (HBS)\nWhat Blackstone values:\nTraits:\u00a0\nself-confidence\n, intellectual\u00a0\ncuriosity\n, courtesy, an ability to\u00a0\nadjust\n\u00a0to new situations,\u00a0\nemotional stability under pressure\n, a zero-defect mentality, an unwavering commitment to behaving with\u00a0\nintegrity\n\u00a0and striving for excellence in all we choose to do,\u00a0\nnice\n\u2014being thoughtful, considerate, and decent\nValues: honesty, common decency, achievement, and generosity toward others (parents)\nPick me ups on a tough day\nSchwarzman failed a lot!\nDuring my senior year, I realized that Harvard was the best-known Ivy League university in America. I believed that my record merited my admission. As it turned out, Harvard didn\u2019t agree. They put me on the wait list\nGoldman Sachs said they liked me but worried I was a little too much my own person, and I never got an offer.\nI arrived at Harvard feeling the same way I had when I arrived at Yale: socially isolated and suspecting the brilliant people were elsewhere.\nIt is inevitable that you will confront many difficulties and hardships during your life. When you face setbacks, you have to dig down and move yourself forward. The resilience you exhibit in the face of adversity\u2014rather than the adversity itself\u2014will be what defines you as a person.\nWhen you\u2019re young, only take a job that provides you with a steep learning curve and strong training. First jobs are foundational. Don\u2019t take a job just because it seems prestigious.\nYou belong here.\nMaybe it was the Freud, or the bars, or the girls I had met along the way. Maybe it was having taken on a challenge and survived. While my classmates were spending the summer hitting tennis balls and working in offices, I had been sweating in an engine room and dodging blows in Colombian bars. But now, I was ready to approach Yale on my own terms.\nTheirs was the first Park Avenue apartment I had ever visited, and I\u2019d never before seen anything like it. It had been decorated by Billy Baldwin, the top decorator in the country at the time. At the entrance, there was a small library, its walls covered in beige grass cloth and hung with Willem de Kooning paintings. When I asked Laura about them, she told me that the artist lived and worked in East Hampton close to her dad\u2019s beach house. De Kooning had come to him for some legal advice and paid with paintings instead of cash. He had needed a lot of advice, so the Eastmans now had a lot of paintings. This had never happened to the Schwarzmans of Abington. Lee made a great impression on me during those family dinners. He was positive, dramatic, engaged, and insightful. He was living the New York life I aspired to have if I could become successful.\nI advise you, if you have any interest in politics whatsoever, to go out and make as much money as you can. That will give you independence if you ever decide you want to go into politics.\nWhen you believe in what you\u2019re doing, overwhelmed or not, you have to keep moving forward, even when the quest feels hopeless.\n"}
{"title": "My Own Words by Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "contents": "A review I wrote last spring. Rest in power, Justice Ginsburg.\nThis book took me forever to get through - November to June. I only just finished the last few pages, which include some of the bench announcements Justice Ginsburg delivered in recent years and highlights of the Court's 2015-2016 term. I would be stretching the truth if I said this was an easy read - for someone with no law degree (yet), I definitely grinded through this book, and there was a lot of Oyez and Wikipedia involved.\u00a0Nevertheless, it has definitely been one of my favorites this year. \nMy Own Words \nis a weird hybrid between biography and memoir and legal tome. Even as a dedicated RBG fan, I learned so much from this book. It's packed with court cases, lectures, historical excerpts, and civil rights legislation. I learned about the purpose of the Supreme Court - \"to repair fractures in federal law, to step in when other courts have disagreed on what the relevant federal law requires.\" In Ginsburg's opinion, the Court's disagreement is what makes it effective. The questions the Court entertains are never easy, and the law is seldom ever clear, but reasoning with depth and precision leads to more prudent decisions.\u00a0\nGinsburg also addressed what a good justice does. He or she uses the best of his or her ability to work for the advancement of the law; reads the whole constitution rather than rewriting it to fit political perspectives; does what the founders said - to found a more perfect union; makes inquiry, not injury, the motivation; seeks to understand others; weighs the interests of others without bias; dialogues with other organs of government and with people as well; and acts with integrity, knowledge, and judgement. \nThroughout the book, Justice Ginsburg emphasized that the primary purpose of the Supreme Court is to find new legal solutions \"to realize a more perfect Union\" and to \"affect the preservation of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" Justice Ginsburg argues that our constitution is a \"living constitution.\" Supreme Court Justices serve the nation not only now, but also in the long term. Our concepts of equality have changed much from when Madison and Jefferson wrote it, so we must keep adapting the law to our era.\u00a0\nI wish I had more extensive legal knowledge to fully appreciate all of Justice Ginsburg's dissents and speeches, but it was cool to connect what I learned in APUSH about the Marshall Court, Taney Court (Dred Scott), Muller v. Oregon, Loving v. Virginia, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Roe v. Wade, Grutter v. Bollinger, with advancements in civil rights. It was especially cool to see what RBG accomplished as a young lawyer at the ACLU, when I was reading her amicus brief for Frontiero v. Richardson, and then her bench announcement for US v. Virginia (a.k.a. the Virginia Military Institute case).\u00a0\nRBG is a badass and I love her. :)\n"}
{"title": "Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates", "contents": "I first read\u00a0\nBetween the World and Me\u00a0\nnearly two years ago. Over the past few days, I have found myself coming back to it quite frequently over the past two weeks. This quote felt particularly salient:\nAll our phrasing\u2014\nrace relations\n,\u00a0\nracial chasm\n,\u00a0\nracial justice\n,\u00a0\nracial profiling\n,\u00a0\nwhite privilege\n, even\u00a0\nwhite supremacy\n\u2014serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth.\u00a0\nI know that I will never be able to fully understand, but I want to stand in solidarity those who are hurting and fighting.\nBetween the World and Me\n\u00a0is an emotional tour de force. Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s writing is humanizing and powerful. His language is one of love, a language transcends all human means of expression, with a punch packed into every word. Written as a letter to his son, Samori, the book explains the disembodiment of African-Americans, the prevalent racism that threatens their day-to-day safety, and the toxic Dream of a post-racial society. Part memoir, part ethnography, and part social commentary, this book serves as a frank portrayal of our brutal racial reality - a country that was built upon the subjugation of African-Americans and continues to enslave millions more through intergenerational poverty and violence. Coates interweaves storytelling with advice for his son; the strong paternal love with which his writing is tinged, his pervasive fear and concern for Samori, is what makes the story so heartbreaking.\u00a0\nThis book does not sugarcoat. It is not optimistic. It fails to present a hopeful vision for the world. Coates\u2019s writing reminded me of the same anger I felt when white people insist to me \u201cracism does not exist,\u201d and that by speaking about this \u201cnon-existent\u201d racism and the discrimination I may face, I am imposing racist attitudes upon myself. Coates embraces this \u201cbreach between the world and [him],\u201d and provides the reader with a consciousness of their troubled society. In his book, Coates talks about how racism is often written off as a natural phenomenon, so deeply engrained into our social fabric that it is inalterable. He also discusses his first-hand experience with gun violence, from his upbringing in West Baltimore to losing a college classmate to a police officer who was ultimately charged with nothing. Coates argues that America\u2019s criminal justice policy is a reflection of the country in \u201call of its will and fear,\u201d and a consequence of majoritarian rule.\u00a0\nAs a woman of color and an intersectional feminist, it was interesting to explore the issues outlined in this book. I will end with one of my favorite quotes from the book, a response to when Saul Bellow\u2019s question, \u201cWho is the Tolstoy of the Zulus?\u201d Tolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus, Coates asserts.

{"title": "Educated by Tara Westover", "contents": "I\u2019ve been recommended this book at least three times now? First my prefect, then two friends from middle school. Even before that, I have seen\u00a0\nEducated\n\u00a0in every store and all over the internet since it came out in 2018.\nI have seen\u00a0\nEducated\n\u00a0compared to J.D. Vance\u2019s\u00a0\nHillbilly Elegy\n, but I don\u2019t think Tara Westover has much in common with J.D. Vance aside from growing up in the Midwest. I certainly did not read this book as a Mormon, female J.D. Vance writing about the path slightly less taken, taking care to sugarcoat the rough parts. For me,\u00a0\nEducated\n\u00a0was about the value and cost of a liberal arts education, and to a greater extent, its ability to liberate and alienate.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLet\u2019s talk first about the ethical costs of receiving an education and moving up.\nI have also been reading Jennifer Morton\u2019s\u00a0\nMoving Up Without Losing Your Way\n\u00a0recently, and that definitely colored the lens through which I read\u00a0\nEducated.\u00a0\nAlthough I am only a fifth of the way through that book, Morton\u2019s central thesis is as follows:\nTranscending the circumstances of one\u2019s birth comes with a heavy cost felt across many aspects of our lives that we value \u2014 relationships with family and friends, our connection to our communes, and our sense of identity.\nI\u2019ve seen this theme about the ethical costs of moving up across the books that I\u2019ve read this year. In\u00a0\nUndocumented\n, Dan-el Padilla Peralta wrote, \u201cI\u2019d be confronted by the differences between HarlemWorld and the Upper West, no matter how hard I tried to shut them out. The hood would come knocking\u2014or just smash through the door.\u201d And it\u2019s certainly a prevalent theme in\u00a0\nEducated\n.\nFor Tara, moving up comes with tremendous consequences: feelings of alienation and guilt. In several instances, Tara writes about feeling as if she had betrayed her family by leaving them behind to pursue an education, and more so to challenge the perspectives handed down by her father.\nI preferred the family I had chosen to the one I had been given, so the happier I became in Cambridge, the more my happiness was made fetid by my feeling that I had betrayed Buck\u2019s Peak.\nEverything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind.\nHere\u2019s another quote from Tara here about traveling through Europe with her Cambridge companions as a first-generation, low income (FGLI) student.\nMy companions moved through the city differently, aware of its significance but not subdued by it...There was a kind of symbiosis in their relationship to these grand places: they gave life to the ancient architecture by making it the backdrop of their discourse, by refusing to worship at its altar as if it were a dead thing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe other takeaway I had comes from the following quote, and it pertains to the liberal arts education that I have the luxury of pursuing. \nCuriosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure: my mind was absorbed with more immediate concerns, such as the exact balance of my bank account, who I owed how much, and whether there was anything in my room I could sell for ten or twenty dollars.\nThere is a lot of talk at my school about intellectual vitality and curiosity \u2014 pursuing knowledge for the sake of itself. In a similar vein, elite students are often criticized for choosing to go into banking, consulting, or finance, or for being overly focused on their careers.\nThis model for evaluating students doesn\u2019t recognize that it is exhausting for financially insecure students to constantly \u201chave curiosity.\u201d It does not sit right with me to evaluate the character of disadvantaged groups in the same context as other privileged groups; for some, it can take as much grit to survive, as someone like me with immense privilege needed to pursue many passion projects with the confidence that I had the resources to thrive.\nI had discerned the ways in which we had been sculpted by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition of which we were either willfully or accidentally ignorant. I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a discourse whose sole purpose was to dehumanize and brutalize others\u2014 because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward.\nIn retrospect, I see that this was my education, the one that would matter: the hours I spent sitting at a borrowed desk, struggling to parse narrow strands of Mormon doctrine in mimicry of a brother who\u2019d deserted me. The skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand.\nTara showed that a liberal arts education is so much more than curiosity and intellectual exploration alone; it is more than thriving in the pursuits of inglorious leisure (\nstudiis florentem ignobilis oti\n, Virgil, Georgics 4.564). Being educated means having the courage to learn and unlearn, questioning what we have been taught, and being patient enough to read things we cannot yet understand.\n"}
{"title": "AI Superpowers by Kai Fu Lee", "contents": "I got my third recommendation for\u00a0\nAI Superpowers\n\u00a0a couple of weeks back (#iykyk), and conveniently had many copies lying around the house, so I decided to pick up this book. I ended up zipping through this book; I feel like it only took me around four hours to read?\nThere were a lot of things that I loved about this book, including the comparison of the Chinese and American startup ecosystems. Kai-Fu Lee also did a really great job of unpacking the things I've observed anecdotally into concrete theory. I had realized the street pedlers in China ask for money via Wechat Wallet, but I did not connect that intuitively with China\u2019s leap in mobile payment platforms.\nThese were my three main ideas:\nThe industrial revolution fueled by electricity is similar to today\u2019s AI revolution, which thrives on an ecosystem of data, entrepreneurs, AI scientists, and AI friendly policy. What will be the new Standard Oil, and who will be the new John D.?\nWhy?\nThe US government deliberately takes a laissez-faire approach to entrepreneurship and is slashing funding for basic research. The Chinese government invests proactively and lends funding + legitimacy to entrepreneurship.\nProfit hungry entrepreneurs mimicking competitors \u27a1\ufe0f relentless iteration, cost control, flawless execution, raising funds at exaggerated valuations\nDifferent goals in entrepreneurship: Silicon Valley: liberal arts + innovative thinking \u27a1\ufe0f clean digital platforms; China\u2019s scarcity mentality: getting rich \u27a1\ufe0f implementation heavy approach, vertically integrated, recruiting users\nAmerican startups favor the \u201clight approach\u201d - sharing information, closing knowledge gaps, connecting people digitally; Chinese startups favor the \u201cheavy approach\u201d - recruit each seller, handle goods, run the delivery team, control payment (ex. mobile payments market)\nIf AI will replace 40-50% of jobs in America within the next 15 years, we need government leaders who are well-versed enough in technology to respond to the impacts of this change. In developing countries, AI-driven automation will undercut their historical economic advantage: cheap labor. Smart cities like Hebei\u2019s Xiong'an will shift power from government to tech companies.\nIn the end, I had two big takeaways from\u00a0\nAI Superpowers\n.\nOne, which Kai-Fu Lee also spoke about in his TED Talk, is the idea that AI, rather than merely eliminating jobs, will give us the freedom to do the work that makes us human. AI can optimize but not innovate.\u00a0The jobs that will be most protected are creatives and caregivers.\nTwo, to always put family first, and to never let my work ethic take precedence over love for my family.\u00a0I hope I will not need a terminal illness to remind me to prioritize eulogy virtues over resume virtues. No matter how influential I become, the people closest to me are the ones I will have the most impact on\nOverall, this book was a fascinating read. My goal in the future is to be well-versed enough in technology to be dangerous. Maybe that will be investing, maybe that will be taking companies public.

{"title": "On the Nature of Things by Lucretius", "contents": "After three grueling and exciting weeks, I finally wrapped up Book VI of Lucretius\u2019s\u00a0\nDe Rerum Natura\n\u00a0today. Although I only read excerpts from Books I, II, V, and VI, it was fascinating to learn about Lucretius\u2019s early postulates on atomism, matter, and the swerve (\nclinamen)\n. Speaking of\u00a0\nThe Swerve\n, I\u2019ve been wanting to read Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s book for a while now. Putting that next on the to read list.\nThroughout books I and II, I had a pervasive fear that internalizing Lucretius\u2019s arguments would destine me for failure in my college physics classes; I enjoyed books V and VI, which describe the development of language, agriculture, and primitive human society, much more. I especially enjoyed his treatment of religion, particularly the idea that we are compelled by fear to believe in divine deities, even when there isn\u2019t definite proof of existence.\nOf all the Latin I\u2019ve read this summer,\u00a0\nDRN\n\u00a0comes as a close second or favorite. I liked the relative simplicity of the language. Lucretius is a didactic poet - he wants to spread the teachings of Epicurus, and he wants to convince the reader (and Memmius) of his beliefs, which made his writing much easier to understand, than, say, Suetonius. I also loved the easter eggs he sprinkled throughout, like the\u00a0\nsitis arida corpora mersans\n\u00a0in line 6.1176 - such a clever oxymoron.\nFavorite lines (and amateur commentary):\nstilicidi casus lapidem cavat (\nLucr.

The English reads as follows: \u201cAnd neither the reputation of the gods nor the lightning bolts nor the sky by means of a threatening murmur restrained him, but by this degree the more greatly he stirred up the sharp virtue of his soul in order that he might desire to first break open the narrow bars of the gates of nature. Then the lively force of his soul thoroughly conquered and he proceeded far beyond the flaming walls of the world and wandered (across) the immense all (i.e. the totality of existence) by means of his mind and soul. And from there, as a victor, he brings back to us what is able to arise, what is not able\u2026\u201d\nThis line reminds me strongly of my middle school years, when we would sing the hymn \u201cJerusalem\u201d, a musical rendition of Wiliam Blake\u2019s \u201cAnd did those feet in ancient time\u201d. My favorite line in that poem was\n\u201cI will not cease from Mental Fight, /\nNor shall my Sword sleep in my hand.\u201d\nEven though Lucretius is talking about Epicurus here, I felt the same sense of intellectual vigor and zest for learning in\u00a0\nDe Rerum Natura\n. Lucretius was right about some things, for instance, the existence of atoms or Brownian motion, and very wrong about others. Regardless of its scientific merits, reading DRN reinvigorated my innate curiosity and willingness to explore the unknown.\nSee my memes here:  https://lindasbookshelf.substack.com/p/de-rerum-natura\n"}

{"title": "Reset by Ellen Pao", "contents": "I have been procrastinating on this blog post, not because I disliked\u00a0\nReset\n\u00a0(quite the opposite, actually), but because of how painful reading this book felt. I was also planning to read Anna Wiener\u2019s\u00a0\nUncanny Valley\u00a0\nlast week after hearing her speak, but I ultimately decided against it because I could not handle any more narratives about sexism in tech (definitely not three books in a row).\nReset\n\u00a0was heartbreaking, because Ellen did everything \u201cright,\u201d or at least she jumped through all the right hoops. Bachelor\u2019s from Princeton in Electrical Engineering. JD from Harvard Law School, MBA from Harvard Business School. Five Ivy League degrees between her and her former husband. Coporate attorney at Cravath, Swaine, & Moore. Partner at Kleiner Perkins, Chief of Staff for John Doerr. A dutiful daughter of Chinese immigrants from Northern New Jersey. The hardest part for me was realizing that her path is the one I aspire to follow and seeing a younger version of Ellen in me.\nAt Kleiner, she built rapport with the CEOs in her portfolio (though perhaps not with her coworkers). She worked three times as hard as everyone else. Starting in college, she \u201cacclimated to before four and six hours of sleep a night\u201d and \u201caveraged two to four hours\u201d at the height of her trial, except this wasn\u2019t the narrative presented by the media or in the trial. Even I questioned if she was \u201clikable\u201d enough, lacking confidence, or asking for too much. After all, she has reached the pinnacle of American society - what more could she ask for? But we would never ask these questions of a man.\nMany chalk up microaggressions (like subtle exclusion, off-hand comments, hostile workplace dynamics) to overreaction, and it is easy to understand why, especially when the \u201csticks and stones\u201d adage comes to mind. But in an industry like venture capital, not having a seat at the table on the plane to Vail or being constantly spoken over can cost billion of dollars, if not more. There\u2019s also the idea of the\u00a0\nglass cliff\n, which is when \u201ca woman breaks through the glass ceiling and is finally handed a position of power\u2026exactly when a company is about to implode.\u201d When the companies fail, the women are held responsible, and critics use them as evidence for women being poor leaders. Leana Wen and Marissa Meyer also come to mind.\nReset\n\u00a0is a worthy read for anyone interested in VC, particularly women. Chapter 6 offers a great overview on funding rounds, carried interest, early-stage investment, and vote trading in VC firms. I found\u00a0\nReset\n\u00a0especially valuable because Ellen Pao sacrificed so much to share her story. She had very little personal incentive for publishing, as she could have received a large settlement from Kleiner for her silence. She made herself and her family a target for abuse from the media and burnt many bridges in the venture community to speak her truth. By suing Kleiner, she fought a losing battle for other women and minorities. It\u2019s clear that she has initiated a conversation about gender parity in venture capital: as of May 2020, Sequoia now has four female partners, all of whom are Asian-American; although Kleiner only has two women on its investment team, both Ajit Nazre and Chi-Hua Chien have left the firm.\nI accept that men and women face different standards in the workplace, especially when they are in positions of leadership; social structures that have been engrained over millennia will take equally long to unravel and evolve. My biggest takeaway, however, is that minorities not only need to fight hard, but also fight smart. Women need to advocate for themselves differently than men, and they may also follow different paths for advancement. Building diversity in tech will require more than being \u201cwarm and welcoming,\u201d so let us be more proactive in approaching women\u2019s leadership.\nWhy do minorities often fall under more scrutiny? How can they escape it?\nHow can disenfranchised groups effectively demand social change?\nWhat should mentorship look like for women?\nHow can women thrive in a male-saturated environment, like in banking or VC?\nDo women have to be likable or agreeable to advance?\nMckinsey Women in the Workplace 2019\nSecrets of Sand Hill Road\n, Scott Kupor (Andreesen Horowitz)\nMeasure What Matters,\u00a0\nJohn Doerr (Kleiner Perkins)\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things,\u00a0\nBen Horowitz (Andreesen Horowitz)\nI would LOVE to read something by Heidi Roizen or Aileen Lee; in the meantime, I will be enjoying their talks on Youtube.\n"}
{"title": "Modern Love: True Stories of Love, Loss, and Redemption ", "contents": "I was quite burned-out from reading two books in a row about sexism in Silicon Valley. Even though they were fascinating, I felt mentally and physically exhausted, and frankly, cynical. After reading heavy nonfiction, I tend to gravitate toward stories about love, so this book felt like a natural fit. I\u2019ve always been a big fan of the NYT Modern Love section. They\u2019re good for unwinding after a long day (and dreaming about the boyfriend I would love to have).\nThis collection of essays was good, but not a standout. I think I enjoyed The Moth\u2019s anthology,\u00a0\nAll These Wonders\n, more. I didn\u2019t like how the writers of these NYT stories were predominantly white, urbane, and privileged, but unfortunately, that\u2019s a given for the NYT. This book is divided into four sections: Somewhere Out There, I Think I Love You, Holding on Through the Curves, and Family Matters. I probably liked I Think I Love You the most. Maybe it\u2019s because I crave stories about falling in love, but also because I\u2019ve read better essays about family and loss in the Modern Love column. I was hoping to finish this book in one sitting for the ultimate feeling of catharsis, but it took me half a week; I felt pretty exhausted by the time I got to the last quarter of the book.\nThat said, it was nice to revisit Amy Krouse Rosenthal\u2019s \u201cYou May Want to Marry My Husband,\u201d which I first read after hearing Jason\u2019s TED talk. I also loved Ayelet Waldman\u2019s \u201cTruly, Madly, Guiltily,\u201d which explores the conflict between parental and spousal love. Her writing is clever and brilliant.\nIf the most erotic form of foreplay to a mother of a small child is, as I\u2019ve heard some women claim, loading the dishwasher or sweeping the floor, then he\u2019s a master of titillation.\nAnd this one:\nHaving found something to usurp me as the sun of his universe does not mean he wants to make love to me any less.\nAnother favorite was Eve Pell\u2019s \u201cThe Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap,\u201d a story about how she fell in love with her partner, Sam, when she was in her seventies and he in his eighties. It made me think about what really matters, and why. There were so many beautiful lines in that essay.\nIn my younger years I would have felt competitive, as if his love for her meant less for me. Now I knew differently, and one night I spoke my mind\u2026Sam and I did things younger people do\u2014we ran and raced, we fell in love and traveled and remodeled a house and got married.\nIn our seventies and eighties, we had been through enough of life\u2019s ups and downs to know who we were, and we had learned to compromise. We knew something about death because we had seen loved ones die. The finish line was drawing closer. Why not have one last blossoming of the heart?\nBest use of five hours? Probably not.

{"title": "You Know You Want This: by Kristen Roupenian", "contents": "I read \u201cCat Person\u201d in the New Yorker last week and loved it, so I also read\u00a0\nYou Know You Want This\u00a0\non a whim. This book has the most mentally and emotionally messed up protagonists I\u2019ve seen; there were parts where the line between vulnerability and perversion felt too thin. In the end, the only two stories I really loved were \u201cCat Person\u201d and \u201cGood Guy\u201d.\nI loved the candor in \u201cCat Person,\u201d the beauty in the way Roupenian captures moments like this one:\n\u201cShe noticed that when she texted him he usually texted her back right away, but if she took more than a few hours to respond his next message would always be short and wouldn\u2019t include a question, so it was up to her to reinitiate the conversation, which she always did\u2026She still didn\u2019t know much about him, because they never talked about anything personal, but when they landed two or three good jokes in a row there was a kind of exhilaration to it, as if they were dancing.\u201d\nI also loved the way she described inertia in Margot\u2019s encounter with Robert:\n\u201cBut the thought of what it would take to stop what she had set in motion was overwhelming; it would require an amount of tact and gentleness that she felt was impossible to summon. It wasn\u2019t that she was scared he would try to force her to do something against her will but that insisting they stop now, after everything she\u2019d done to push this forward, would make her seem spoiled and capricious, as if she\u2019d ordered something at a restaurant and then, once the food arrived, had changed her mind and sent it back.\u201d\n\u201cCat Person\u201d captures the vulnerability of reckless love through small, universal moments: the adrenaline of the initial text exchanges, the late-night rendezvous-vous at 7-Eleven, and the clumsiness between two people who will never know each other.\nMargot is unaware of the consequences until they injure her. She even ignores the consequences of which she is aware, including the feelings of obligation which arise from the age gap and power imbalance in her relationship. When Margot tells her parents, \u201cHis name is Robert, and I met him at the movie theater. We\u2019re in love, and we\u2019re probably going to get married,\u201d it becomes clear that she is in love with the idealized version of Robert in her mind.\n\u201cCat Person\u201d illuminated the gray instances where sex enters a blurry line of consent. One reviewer in\u00a0\nThe Cut\n\u00a0had written, \"There was this moment of absolute sickness when I felt how Margot had essentially withdrawn her consent to move forward in her mind, but went ahead anyways, because of this pressure she felt from Robert and the concern for what he would think if she stopped short.\" Roupenian captured the moments when we oblige out of inertia, because of our fear of disappointing or leading someone on for nothing.\nThe other story I really loved was \u201cGood Guy.\u201d It\u2019s a clever twist on the trope of settling for a \u201cgood guy\u201d you have relegated to the friend zone. The protagonist, Ted, falls in love with a popular, unattainable girl named Anna, who is in an on-off relationship with Marco. Ted is content with pining for Anna from afar, being her emotional crutch, and dating a girl he has no feelings for, but he eventually realizes that if he \u201ckept his feelings hidden from them, girls\u2014some of them, at least\u2014liked him quite a lot.\u201d\nWhen Anna returns home from college and sees Ted with his girlfriend, her jealousy and insecurity fuel her ardor for Ted, who eagerly reciprocates them. Although Ted\u2019s relationship with Anna does not last, it colors his subsequent relationships. Ted learns that by adopting the persona of a \u201cgood guy\u201d who falls within reach, women out of his league will often \u201csettle\u201d for him in turn. Ted turns the tables.\n\u201cThe older he gets, the higher his stock rises. More and more women want out of that endless chase after Marcos; they yearn to collapse into the arms of their Teds.\u201d\nEven though I usually root for the underdog, I\u2019m not a fan of Ted; he emotionally manipulates and injures the women who settle for him. But we are all guilty of having Teds in our lives, whether a significant other or close friend. Perhaps this is a fitting punishment.\n"}
{"title": "Brotopia by Emily Chang", "contents": "I picked up\u00a0\nBrotopia\n\u00a0because I saw it on a Women in Business Instagram post. I downloaded a sample, got through it fairly quickly, and ended up buying the book, which I finished within a few days. There\u2019s a ton of information in this book, which makes it hard to summarize within three main ideas, but I\u2019ve tried my best below.\nIn part because I have not yet worked in tech and have joined so many diversity pipeline programs (#BUILTBYGIRLS, Girls Who Code, Rewriting the Code, now Google\u2019s CSSI program), I feel incredibly fortunate to have found a welcoming environment for women thus far. I knew about unconscious bias and the underrepresentation of women in STEM, but I didn\u2019t realize the full extent of the challenges women faced until I read\u00a0\nBrotopia.\nFirst, there\u2019s the sheer lack of diversity. As of 2018, women made up 31% of Google and about a fifth of vital technical roles. In venture capital, women made up 8% partners of top firms*, and women-led companies received only 2 percent of venture funding**. This is partly because the vast majority of VCs are men who largely invest their capital in companies run by other men, but also because women are more likely to start companies in sectors where growth is expected to be lower, such as e-commerce and parenting, rather than in areas with huge growth potential, such as AI.\nAcross tech, women suffer from the consequences of working on predominantly male teams. Professionally, they often experience a hostile work environment (including sexual advances), lack of advancement, and higher attrition rates: women exit the tech industry at a rate 45 percent higher than men. These cultural challenges continue outside the workplaces. Chang writes,\n\u201cTo drink with the boys is a double-edged sword. If women don\u2019t participate, they\u2019re seen as uptight and not team players. And they risk missing out on group-bonding time, which may cost them personal and political capital within the organization.\u201d\nWomen also face challenges that are harder to quantify, including self doubt and stereotype threat, the idea that when minorities are forced to identify as minorities, their performance suffers. This was quote from Amy Klement, an early employee at Paypal, was particularly poignant:\n\u201cWhen we were talking about the success of PayPal, the theme I would hear from the men was \u2018We were really smart. We worked really hard,\u2019 and the theme I heard from women was \u2018God, we were lucky.\u2019\u201d\nWomen have a tendency to undersell themselves and to be scrutinized more closely. These disadvantages add up.\nI love reading about the cultural history of the Valley, or even history in general, because everything today is shaped by what happened in the past.\nSteve Jobs influenced an entire generation of entrepreneurs in their vocabulary (\u201cbozos\u201d), appearance (black turtleneck, unblinking stare), and personality traits (a volatile mixture of supreme self-confidence, hubris, and fearlessness of risk). Burning Man reflects the Valley\u2019s ethos of independence, free will, and perhaps even polyamory. The 1960s Cannon-Perry test cemented programmers in popular imagination as a group of hunched, hoodie-clad, anti-social nerds who write code hunched in front of computer monitors, a stereotype which holds true today. Larry and Sergey (and many others) began as coders in an underutilized garage \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s Horatio Alger Myth.\nI liked how\u00a0\nBrotopia\n\u00a0provided a female-centric history of the Valley. Wojicki was the pioneer of Adwords and Adsense, for which Sandberg led the business unit. Mayer. Chang helped me see that despite the challenges women face, there has always been a place for women in the valley. After all, Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program.\nFor women to have a place in tech today, we must rewrite the narrative.\nBut there was another story to tell: that Google\u2019s success had at least as much to do with making bets on strong female leaders like Mayer, Sandberg, and Wojcicki who brought wider skill sets and different management styles to the company in its earliest days\u2026Early Google had proven that diversity in the workplace needn\u2019t be based on altruism or some goal of social engineering. It was simply a good business decision.\nSomething\u00a0\nBrotopia\n\u00a0failed to sell me on is the idea that diversity is a moral and business imperative. Chang cites a wide array of statistics on how companies with diverse leadership are more successful, e.g. \u201cA study from the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that companies whose leadership was at least 30 percent female were 6 percent more profitable,\u201d but I felt that the book had too much casual reasoning. Sure, there are risks when companies fail to incorporate inclusion, but according to Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Greylock, \u201cThe most important thing [for startups] is that all team members, whoever they are and wherever they come from, cohere quickly on the company mission.\u201d Homogeneous teams may be less innovative, but a trait of successful startups is cultural cohesion, especially in periods of rapid growth.\nI wonder if it is possible to achieve diversity for the sake of diversity (and without any driving economic incentive).\nIt\u2019s good to be asking ourselves how to create diversity and why we should value diversity, but I think the bigger questions we should be asking is how we can get the non-female population of Silicon Valley to truly buy into this vision. Right now, they don\u2019t. In one of the opening lines of this book, Chang writes,\nIn Silicon Valley today, women are second-class citizens and\u00a0\nmost men are blind to it.\nI believe the second part is key. The way\u00a0\nBrotopia\n\u00a0is written antagonizes men. Women need to learn how to communicate the value of diversity to a white, male audience, even if it may feel like Zuck explaining the internet to senators in the 2018 Congressional Hearing.\nThe Innovator\ns, Walter Isaacson\nRadical Candor\n, Kim Scott\nLean In\n, Sheryl Sandberg\nReset\n, Ellen Pao\n*Dana Olsen, Do Female Founders Get Better Results?

{"title": "The Privileged Poor by Anthony Abraham Jack", "contents": "Here\u2019s the central thesis: Anthony Abraham Jack divides low-income students at elite universities into two groups. The first group is the\u00a0\nprivileged poor\n, students who come from underprivileged backgrounds but graduated from elite prep schools or boarding schools through diversity programs like Prep for Prep and the Wight Foundation. The second group is the\u00a0\ndoubly disadvantaged\n, students from poverty-stricken urban (or rural) areas lacking the cultural capital that the privileged poor acquired at prep school.\nWhen I read through this book, I was shocked by how closely the hidden curriculum at elite colleges mirrors the hidden curriculum at boarding schools. Boarding school teaches students to proactively seek help and cultivate strong relationships with faculty - two skills that are crucial for college and career success. When the privileged poor arrive at universities such as Renowned (i.e. Harvard), they are accustomed to extreme wealth and talent. They know how to navigate elite spaces, and their familiarity breeds a sense of ease. The doubly disadvantaged, however, struggle with increased academic pressure and the added cultural shock when they first arrive on campus. They lack the coded vocabulary of privilege (from locales like Manhasett to brands of popular clothing to sports like crew) and don\u2019t feel nearly as comfortable reaching out to faculty for academic or personal support. Because of the divisions that these subtle pieces of know-how foster, Jack argues that \u201caccess isn\u2019t inclusion\u201d for low-income students.\u00a0\nRather than highlighting three main ideas, as I typically do for non-fiction, I will, instead, discuss three ideas that intrigued me.\u00a0\nCulture shock occurred when they entered their private school, usually as high school freshmen, not when they entered Renowned as first-year undergraduates. Feelings of isolation and difference hit them when they left their distressed, often segregated public middle school for a posh, white private high school.\nI used to think of this culture shock as a \u201cbaptism by fire.\u201d The privileged poor had already experienced the painful process of assimilation and learned to navigate the unspoken social rules of elite institutions. By the time they arrived at Harvard, they could succeed.\u00a0\nMy transition from day school to boarding school in ninth grade was much more comfortable than my transition from a public school to a private school in seventh grade. By then, I already knew what a preppy wardrobe would look like \u2014 Vineyard Vines, Hunter rain boots, Patagonia sweaters \u2014 and had the foresight to buy them on sale during the summer. I went to enough bat mitzvahs to have a surface understanding of Judaism. I knew basic blessings in Hebrew, gifts are to be in multiples of 18 (\u201cchai\u201d), and to know that Passover means no leavened bread. I had also learned the importance of signaling for building connection. Humans are innately tribal - we are drawn to those who look like us, talk like us, and think like us.\nBut I wonder if this transition must be so painful. As a twelve-year-old, I remember attempting to communicate these challenges to my parents, with minimal success. Because I lacked the proper vocabulary, my parents mistook the pain I felt while acquiring this social capital as ingratitude, further compounding the difficulty of the transition itself. If low-income students receive guidance from alumni and mentors on the social and cultural aspects of their education, they might not feel so lost. Admissions officers can hold a community-oriented retreat before classes start, offer a social skills training course, and facilitate open discussions about socioeconomic diversity, or the lack thereof. If administrators proactively reached out to low-income students, they would feel better prepared to enter an entirely foreign world.\nIn my middle school (which was mentioned in this book), nearly a fifth of the class matriculated to Harvard each year. There were only two types of students: one, the legacies and donors, and two, the students who came in through Prep in seventh grade. It makes sense why schools like Harvard would want to recruit almost exclusively from organizations like Prep. While Prep students meet the diversity quotas for elite universities, they are also well-guaranteed to meet the unique social and academic demands.\u00a0\nFor the longest time, I held Prep in the highest esteem. I saw Prep as a great equalizer of society, its graduates living proof of the Horatio Alger myth. My friends who graduated from Prep (and most have gone on to Harvard) are the most brilliant, compassionate, and hard-working people I know. I am in awe of their resilience, drive, and genuine desire to use their education to give back.\u00a0\nBut in the conclusion of this book, Anthony Abraham Jack argues that although programs like Prep for Prep and A Better Chance create a pipeline for disadvantaged students,\u00a0\nthey benefit individuals rather than the collective\n. This idea brought to mind a conversation I had with my mom, when I told her that I would want to send my children to my alma mater if I had the financial means. She told me that I had the wrong life goal: I should be thinking about how to make that education accessible for all children instead.\u00a0\nCan \u201cnormal\u201d (non-magnet) public schools in high poverty areas produce students who can succeed at institutions like Harvard? Can online learning help accelerate this revolution?\nThe Privileged Poor know what life is like below the poverty line. They also know how the 1 percent learn and live. In his memoir,\u00a0\nUndocumented\n, Dan-el Padilla Peralta, a graduate of New York\u2019s Collegiate School and current Classics professor at Princeton, wrote,\nI\u2019d be confronted by the differences between HarlemWorld and the Upper West, no matter how hard I tried to shut them out. The hood would come knocking\u2014or just smash through the door.\nThere is an emotional cost to their code-switching, which creates divisions between them and the family members they left at home. Besides gratitude and resilience, how can we bridge these differences?\u00a0\nLots of food for thought!\u00a0\n"}
{"title": "The Hidden Girl and Other Stories by Ken Liu", "contents": "Yesterday, I went to a webinar featuring Ken Liu, in which he talked about the value of stories. According to Liu, stories are maps for what it means to live a good life, to be fully human.\nAs humans, we are guided by a need for self-definition and self narrative. We want to be surrounded by objects of meaning, to know that we made a dent in the universe or brought joy to someone\u2019s life. Liu argues that this kind of tangible, \u201cputting ourselves out there into the world\u201d is at the core of storytelling and technology. Writing is a technology we invented to share our thoughts, and technology is about putting our cognition out into the world. We are continuously trying to make sense of our lives by telling a story of who we are and how we came to be. We make our values real by enacting them and turning them into stories.\nSo unlike the other authors I\u2019ve enjoyed recently, like Ocean Vuong or Chen Chen, it\u2019s not the writing in\u00a0\nThe Hidden Girl\n\u00a0that makes it so beautiful, but the ideas encapsulated within the text. It\u2019s the intricacy of the narrative, the thought experiments each story represents. These stories hover in an uncanny valley of being fantastic enough to strike fear and real enough to be plausible. After all, the singularity is not a question of if, but when. As I raced through these stories, I found myself pondering questions about morality and mortality.\nA criminal who murders may still be a good father, husband, brother, and son - must we punish the whole person? (\u201cThe Reborn\u201d)\nHow accurate is photographic representation? Can we substitute an online consciousness for reality? How much should social media companies moderate content? Should they have the power of arbiters of truth and decency for an entire society? (\u201cThoughts and Prayers\u201d)\nHow we can continue to make the world a better place when policy is tempered by realism? Can we commoditize suffering for a noble goal? (\u201cByzantine Empathy\u201d)\nWhen we do reach singularity, what is the right way to live, and what is the right way to die? Does the authenticity of our messy existence, including pain and suffering, make us human? (\u201cStaying Behind\u201d)\nReading\u00a0\nThe Hidden Girl\n helped me see technology as an artistic process: taking existing tropes and putting them together to solve new problems. Engineering is the most important art we know how to practice as a species, a way to explain to the universe who we are. Storytelling is how we give ourselves hope, the strength to climb up and to keep going.\n"}

I actually hated this book at first because of how pretentious it felt. There was too much name-dropping in this book: William Carlos Williams, Levar Burton, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, Edo-Ukiyoe, Didier, Trakl, Madame Bovary, Sisyphus, Paul Celan, Ayn Rand, and probably other allusions that I missed. I don\u2019t like how Chen Chen tries so hard to be intellectual and uses ampersands instead of \u201cand.\u201d\nThere was this super funny, self-aware moment when Chen Chen writes, \u201cI\u2019m remembering what a writer friend once said to me, All you write about is being gay or Chinese\u2014how I can\u2019t get over that, & wonder if it\u2019s true.\u201d I think it is mostly true. For some reason, I did not connect with Chen Chen the same way I did with Ocean Vuong, even though so many people I follow on Goodreads spoke so highly of this book. Sure, Chen Chen\u2019s language is playful and inventive, but I never felt the same sense of vulnerability in the other books of poetry that I really enjoyed. It seemed to me that Chen Chen was too eager to hide behind his words.\nThat said, there were two or three poems that I really enjoyed: \u201cFOR I WILL DO/UNDO WHAT WAS DONE/UNDONE TO ME\u201d and the titular poem, \u201cWhen I Grow Up I Want to Be a List of Further Possibilities.\u201d And throughout the book, there were some pretty clever lines that made me smile, like \u201cI am knowledgeable in advanced aftermath,\u201d or \u201cTo be a cyclone of laughter when my parents say their new coworker is\u00a0\nlike that\n, they can tell\u00a0\nbecause he wears pink socks, see, you don\u2019t, so you can\u2019t be one of them.\n\u201d\ntl;dr: off-brand Ocean Vuong, solid 3/5\n"}

I learned a lot about early-stage entrepreneurship \u2014 how to build a brand, how to scale a company, how to lead a team.\nHere are my three main takeaways:\nMy biggest takeaway from Knight is the\u00a0\nvalue in taking a meandering path\n: all of Knight\u2019s previous roles \u2014 track athlete (how to keep running), securities salesman (how to sell an idea), army lieutenant (how to lead a team), certified public accountant (how to make a profit) \u2014 helped him build Nike.\nso that you can get up quickly (and implement the lesson you learned). For Knight, each failure led to subsequent growth: losing Onitsuka gave Nike the autonomy to develop into one of the most creative brands in the world.\nWhen you have a\u00a0\nunified vision\n, people will devote themselves wholly to a cause. Johnson worked nonstop for years and relocated to the East Coast, leaving behind his wife and young son, for Nike. Sumeragi of Nissho hid invoices in his desk drawer to make Nike\u2019s debt appear lower, because after working with Knight every day, he believed Nike would one day grow into a big company.\nAlso, here are some of my other favorite quotes/excerpts:\n\u201cI stood before the David, shocked at the anger in his eyes. Goliath never had a\u00a0\nchance\n.\u201d\n\u201c[At Oregon] I\u2019d competed with, and against, men far better, faster, more physically gifted. Many were future Olympians. And yet I\u2019d trained myself to forget this unhappy fact. People reflexively assume that competition is always a good thing, that it always brings out the best in people, but that\u2019s only true of people who can forget the competition.\u00a0\nThe art of competing, I\u2019d learned from track, was the art of forgetting\n, and I now reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. You must forget that internal voice screaming, begging, \u201cNot one more step!\u201d And when it\u2019s not possible to forget it, you must negotiate with it. I thought of all the races in which my mind wanted one thing, and my body wanted another, those laps in which I\u2019d had to tell my body, \u2018Yes, you raise some excellent points, but let\u2019s keep going anyway\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOne lesson I took from all my home-schooling about heroes was that they didn\u2019t say much. None was a blabbermouth. None micromanaged.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t tell people how to do things\n, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.\u201d\n\u201cStarting my own business was the only thing that made life\u2019s other risks \u2014 marriage, Vegas, alligator wrestling \u2014 seem like sure things. But my hope was that when I failed, I\u2019d\u00a0\nfail quickly\n, so I\u2019d have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard-won lessons. I wasn\u2019t much for setting goals, but this goal kept flashing through my mind every day, until it became my internal chant:\u00a0\nFail fast.\n\u201d\n\u201cThe single easiest way to find out how you feel about someone: say good-bye.\u201d\n\u201cLife is growth. You grow or you die.\u201d\n\u201cWoodell and I were very different, and yet our friendship was based on a selfsame approach to work. Each of us found pleasure, whenever possible, in focusing on one small task. One task, we often said, clears the mind.\u201d\n\u201cThis is our moment. No more selling someone else\u2019s brand. Nor more working for someone else. Onitsuka\u2019s late deliveries, mixed-up orders, refusal to implement design ideas \u2014 they are no more. If we\u2019re going to succeed, or fail, we should do so on our own terms, with our own ideas \u2014 our own brand.

I started\u00a0\nDigital Minimalism\n\u00a0to reduce the time I spend on social media. Initially, I thought Cal Newport would only offer strategies for a digital detox, which I could just start on my own. However, my biggest takeaway from this book was not\u00a0\nhow\n\u00a0we can reduce screen time , but\u00a0\nwhy\n\u00a0we should. Learning about the ways technology is engineered to be addictive helped me gain a better understanding for why I was drawn to social media and become more mindful about my technology use.\nSocial media thrives on the attention economy, the business sector that profits from gathering consumers\u2019 attention and selling it to advertisers. For users, notifications provide intermittent variable rewards, which produce more dopamine and are more enticing than those delivered with a known pattern. If we are not intentional about technology use, the overall negative cost, including the loss of authentic connection and increased loneliness, will outweigh the small benefits that each service provides. Newport has a very apt metaphor for this: the rewards reaped from social media are like the prize at the bottom of the cereal box, \"something appealing to get you to tap the app, at which point they can proceed with their primary objective of extracting as many minutes of your time and attention as possible for their profit machine.\u201d\nBefore reading this book, a fear that barred me from quitting social media was losing touch with friends. However, I learned that if I limit my social engagement to my most serious relationships, I will only lose touch with the people I don't need to be constantly in touch with: some people will inevitably fall out of my social orbit. Moreover, we rarely, if ever, spend time alone with our thoughts just thinking and doing nothing. How can we find what matters to us, what our thoughts are, what emotions we feel, how we feel about our friends, if we never have time to think?\nTo make the most of technology, we need to think critically about what we want to get out of each service, and how we can use technology to help us cultivate leisure, not as the primary source of leisure. Newport's philosophy of Digital Minimalism tells us that it's best to lead a curated digital life (signing in only for specific, high-value purposes) and to be okay with missing out on everything else.\nHere are my three main takeaways:\nTechnology is not neutral; it is engineered to be used for long periods of time by exploiting vulnerabilities in human psychology (e.g. drive for social approval) for profit\nCarve out time for more meaningful connections (active relationships only with the people you value) and solitude (a prerequisite for original and creative thought)\nBe intentional - use technology for cultivating leisure, not as the primary source of leisure; replace low-value digital habits with high-quality leisure activities; schedule leisure time; think critically about about what exactly you want to get out of each use\npare down list of (Facebook) friends to bare minimum and unfollow them\ndelete social media apps from your phone (and check only on Fridays/Saturdays on your computer)\nset up a regular schedule for calling and texting friends - this will support your most serious relationships; you will only lose touch with the people you don't need\ngo on gratitude walks to appreciate the good weather and the things that are making you happy :)\nkeep your phone in Do Not Disturb mode by default, and check texts only on a regular schedule so that they are not a persistent source of ongoing chatter\nstart a \u201cconversation office hour\u201d - set aside a certain time each day (maybe your commute time) for friends to call you -\u201cI\u2019d love to get up to speed on what\u2019s going on in your life, call me at 5:30 pm sometime.\u201d\ntry to learn and apply one new skill every week, over a period of six weeks\nschedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure\ncreate a seasonal leisure plan (3x/year: September, January, May) for objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season (ex. reduce low-level leisure to 1 hr/day, read something in bed every night, attend a cultural event each week)\n"}
{"title": "The Education of an Idealist by Samantha Power", "contents": "The Education of an Idealist\n\u00a0took me a while to get through, but it\u2019s probably the best book I\u2019ve read all year. Power\u2019s writing gave me a fascinating insider look at American foreign policy and the Obama cabinet; it also offered many valuable insights on finding work-life balance for women, pursuing a civil service career, and as the title suggests, reconciling one\u2019s ideals with reality.\u00a0\nPower is a great storyteller. I was impressed by her fearlessness, tenacity, and compassion. Several parts of the book (especially parts about her childhood) brought me to tears; others made me laugh out loud. Though I enjoyed her detailed account of her time in the Obama administration and NSC, I especially loved her anecdotes. I appreciated her frankness, owning up to her disastrous blunder as an Obama staffer (called Hillary Clinton a \u201cmonster\u201d during her book tour in Ireland) or sharing candidly about John Kerry\u2019s surprise at the other end of the phone when he found out that she was breastfeeding her daughter before a conference call. I loved that Samantha Power rapped along to Drake with her husband (Cass Sunstein) the day before her senate hearing (\u201cstarted from the bottom, now we here\u201d). What a queen.\nI\u2019m sure I will revisit this book when I\u2019m doing another policy-related internship, applying to law school, or going to law school. This book is also filled with book recommendations, all of which I have added to my burgeoning list:\u00a0\n1L\n\u00a0by Scott Turow;\u00a0\nSwitch\n\u00a0by Chip and Dan Heath;\u00a0\nExit, Voice, and Loyalty\n\u00a0by Alan Hirschman;\u00a0\nEvery Day is Extra\n\u00a0by John Kerry;\u00a0\nThe Confidence Code\n\u00a0by Kay and Shipman.\nHere are my three main takeaways:\n\u2014 not just a flashy position to aspire to. Being president means meeting the needs of all 330 million Americans. Being Congressman means advocating for every constituent at home. Being Ambassador to the UN means standing up for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who are persecuted and displaced, protecting civilians from the scourge of war while balancing their human rights with national policy (i.e. Assad\u2019s use of chemical weaponry and Obama\u2019s inability to intervene in Syria).\u00a0\nBeing an idealist means trying trying our best to bridge this gap and doing good in the process.\u00a0\nBeing a public servant requires making decisions every day\u2014decisions that can have unintended outcomes, even life or death consequences. But governments and institutions are made of people, and human decisions can create positive change. As Ambassador, Power spurred actions that improved people\u2019s lives.\nAlthough America has committed many atrocities and still embroils itself in messy peripheral conflicts, other countries still look to America to negotiate peace around the world. And sometimes, negotiating peace involves difficult tradeoffs. I was surprised while reading some parts of this book that Power (as UN ambassador) advocated for military action. Here\u2019s her defense: \u201cI cared above all about consequences. I believed that the most important part of decision-making was not the justness of one\u2019s intentions but the effectiveness of one\u2019s actions.\u201d According to Power, the US can use its military to save civilian lives, e.g. instituting a no-fly zone.\u00a0\nI felt very inspired by seeing an immigrant mother of two young children serve at one of the highest levels of government. Power\u2019s humility, integrity, and kindness make her the type of leader I aspire to be.\u00a0\n"}
{"title": "The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu", "contents": "Since reading the titular short story, I\u2019ve reread this book several times. Each time, Ken Liu\u2019s writing blows me away. I cried. It\u2019s hard to write about familial love, cultural assimilation, and identity, but Ken Liu did just that, and in an absolutely beautiful way.\nCatullus 3? Boy, that really got me. I loved \u2018State Change\u2019. That story kept me up until 3am, dreaming about someone who would answer me back when I recited Latin to them. Welp - I think I just halved my dating pool again.\u00a0\nActually, this book is stunning. It made me cry and laugh and think critically about who I am and what is my place in the world. Ken Liu writes with the alacrity of a classicist, the technical expertise of an engineer, and the moral conscience of a lawyer. Every story in this book I loved. This book made me feel proud to be Chinese-American - to have the cultural legacy of two of the most powerful and storied countries in the world; it made me fall in love with Cambridge all over again (see you in four years?); it helped me see the broad connections between ethics and technology.\nI think that\u2019s the beauty of science fiction - by building worlds that do not yet exist, we are preparing ourselves for them. We know that the past is linked inextricably to the present, so the present is also linked to the future. We can\u2019t predict what the future can be, but we can only hope.\u00a0\n"}
{"title": "When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi", "contents": "When Breath Becomes Air\n\u00a0has been on my to-read list since forever, but I never really got around to it. I was on the plane and feeling the altitude, so I was craving a memoir or something with an emotional punch, and this book came up in my ebook library.\nOut of all of the careers I have entertained, medicine was never one of them. I am not sure why. Maybe it was the thought of blood that scared me. Kalanithi became a doctor to find the tangible in what makes life meaningful. \u201cI studied literature and philosophy to understand what makes life meaningful, studied neuroscience and worked in an fMRI lab to understand how the brain could give rise to an organism capable of finding meaning in the world,\u201d he writes, and that \u201cMoral speculation was puny compared to moral action.\u201d\nI really liked this book because it made me realize that prognoses are human; statistics, like the Kaplan-Meier, are human (especially once you become a point on the curve); medicine is human. The word patient comes from the Latin verb patior, pati, passus sum, which means to suffer. While doctors see patients at their most vulnerable, and do so with compassion and care, it was interesting to read about Kalanithi\u2019s transition from doctor to patient - the willing relinquishing of power he had to undergo.\u00a0\nI want to write about how smart his prose is: pithy one-liners like \u201cI resolved to treat all my paperwork as patients, and not vice versa.\u201d \u201cWith one of the ER residents covering for me, I slipped back in, ghostlike, to save the ice cream sandwich in front of the corpse of the son I could not.\u201d Or, \u201cThe question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.\u201d But given the gravity of his book, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. Kalanithi left his mark in reaching what he himself describes as a \u201cpluperfect state.\u201d And he did so with such grace and humility.\u00a0\n"}
{"title": "Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell", "contents": "If I could condense this book to one sentence, it would be this: every story is more nuanced than it first appears to be, and rather than having an absolute right or wrong, conflict often arises from a lapse in communication between people who don\u2019t know each other well.\nHere are my three main takeaways:\nGladwell focuses on several reasons why we are so bad at talking to strangers.\n1.\u00a0\nTruth default\n\u00a0- We are biased in favor of the most likely interpretation (ex. Madoff).\n2.\u00a0\nTransparency\n\u00a0- We believe that we can easily understand strangers. We believe (falsely) that their facial expressions and mannerisms accurately reflect their emotions and character (ex. Hitler and Chamberlain).\n3.\u00a0\nCoupling\n\u00a0- Behaviors are linked to specific circumstances and conditions (ex. Sylvia Plath, suicide, Gladwell's dad getting sentimental when reading Dickens).\nOverall, I thought the stories were interesting, even if they felt loosely tied together. I would have enjoyed more nuanced explanations rooted in science and psychology.\u00a0\nTalking to Strangers\u00a0\nlacked a clear throughline or take-away. In the end, the only advice Gladwell offers for \"talking to strangers\" is to exercise restraint and humility.\n"}
{"title": "Know My Name by Chanel Miller", "contents": "I remember reading the Stanford victim impact statement on Buzzfeed News in summer 2016. I had just finished my freshman year of high school and turned fifteen years old. It was June, so only a few days after my birthday. I probably found it because of theSkimm, an email newsletter I subscribe to. Emily Doe\u2019s prose was sharp, her words inspiring. I felt her presence when she wrote: \"To girls everywhere, I am with you.\" I remember talking to my parents about it in the car the day after and not managing to elicit much of a response from them.\nFast forward to New Year's Eve this year. I read\u00a0\nKnow My Name\n\u00a0on a whim.\nI stepped onto Stanford's campus for the first time this April. With Cardinal Red tinted glasses, I was enamored by the fountain hopping, the funny dancing tree mascot, the \"intellectual vitality\" I had written about in my essays and found in the brilliant, quirky, and humble people I would soon call my classmates. When I think of Tressider, I think of Jamba Juice and Panda Express. Chanel's Tressider is Brock Turner's defense attorney questioning her on which parking lot she had been dropped off at, \"behind the bookstore or in front of the bookstore.\" Chanel's Stanford was the corporate monolith that denied any wrongdoing and failed to offer her any support.\u00a0\nFor the first time, I felt ashamed of my university: ashamed of the administrators who cared more about the brand they were cultivating than the society they encouraged their students to serve.\u00a0\nThrough Chanel, I learned how agonizing and taxing, financially and emotionally, the legal process is for survivors. The \"system\" isn't merely broken. It does not exist for victims, women who didn't choose to become victims and do not like to be identified as so. I saw the double standards that are engrained in the legal process. The burden of proof on plaintiffs is incredibly high, while defendants have much more leeway for why they fail to recall crucial details. I saw this imbalance in the way reporters and attorneys reduced Emily Doe to ten syllables - \u201cunconscious intoxicated woman\u201d- in the way they picked apart her weight, her past relationships, her drinking habits in college, while for Turner, they focused on his academic and athletic accolades. Judge Persky wanted a light sentence so as not further impact his unmet potential.\u00a0\nWomen are always judged more by their pasts, men by their futures.\nChanel channeled her pain into purpose, to fight for girls like me. Chanel writes, \"In court, the judge is the captain of the ship. My captain sunk us. She turned their ship, pointing them toward the horizon. It was my hope that Stanford could be that kind of an institution, willing to be a leader in protecting survivors.\" I don\u2019t yet know when or how, but someday, I do hope to be that better captain and to fight for her.\n"}
{"title": "The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera", "contents": "I loved and hated this book.\nThere were just some parts I didn\u2019t understand, some parts that I felt were too pretentious. I would love to read it with a class. The whole part about Beethoven and \u201ces muss sein\u201d didn\u2019t resonate with me. I didn\u2019t understand the role of Petrin Hill. I liked the discussion of the Grand March and the critique of communism, but sometimes I felt that Kundera was trying to tackle too much.\nI like the way Kundera sketches his characters, the way he etches symbolism into the odd details. I still remember Sabina\u2019s bowler hat, the necklace that Marie Claude belittles her over to demonstrate her power, the suitcase Tereza leaves at the station: those images stick well.\nI loved the descriptions of Tereza and her mother, Tereza as a young girl, and Karenin. I cried when I read the scene where Tomas was digging a grave for him, just the way Tereza wanted. He\u2019s loyal.\nI still don\u2019t know what \u201cthe unbearable lightness of being\u201d is, but I like that Kundera didn\u2019t put a value judgment on it. Kundera didn\u2019t say that being light and carefree is irresponsible or that all of our actions must have a consequence. Kundera doesn\u2019t condemn Tomas or Sabina; he even paints them in a sympathetic light. For Tereza and Tomas, fidelity required sacrifice. It\u2019s funny to think that Mao wrote about the same ideas in \u4e3a\u4eba\u6c11\u670d\u52a1 in 1944: \u201cIf man has one life to live, he can choose to live with the gravity of Mount Tai or the levity of a feather\u201d (\u201c\u4eba\u56fa\u6709\u4e00\u6b7b, \u6216\u91cd\u4e8e\u6cf0\u5c71\uff0c \u6216\u8f7b\u4e8e\u9e3f\u6bdb\u201d). Even then, Mao was quoting Sima Qian (\u53f8\u9a6c\u8fc1), a Chinese historian of the early Han dynasty. During the twelfth century, Hildegard of Bingen, a twelfth-century abbess, called herself \u201ca feather on the breath of God.\u201d So we\u2019ve definitely been entertaining Kundera\u2019s question about the lightness of being for a long time.\n"}
{"title": "Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson ", "contents": "This book took me two months to finish because it was so long. But I really enjoyed Isaacson\u2019s writing. Here are my three main takeaways:\n1. Everything about Apple, down to why Flash doesn\u2019t run on iOS, is a result of Jobs\u2019 legacy. Jobs favored closed systems. Unlike the hacker culture of the Homebrew Computer Club, which encouraged hobbyists tweaking the products they used, Jobs wanted just products his products to be unmodifiable. Just like a tasting menu at a fine dining restaurant, a work of art can\u2019t be modified or tailored.\u00a0\n2. Jobs\u2019 reality distortion field: Job had an uncanny ability to empower the people around him to achieve beyond their potential. He used his charm and manipulation to motivate them and break them down.\u00a0\n3. The integration of technology and humanities: Jobs was a firm proponent for the marriage of engineering and design. Divisions at Apple were run under product lines; visionaries like Jony Ive worked closely with engineers. Jobs himself was not a great engineer, but he spotted good ideas and created great products (good artists borrow, great artists steal). Jobs wanted Apple products to be beautiful, meticulously crafted with smooth edges and curves, like a Porsche or B\u00f6sendorfer piano; Pixar, too, was born from Jobs\u2019s passion for artistry. This same legacy of pursuing the liberal arts in conjunction with STEM is still a core tenet of Stanford\u2019s teaching philosophy.\nI think what I liked the most about reading this book was seeing how profoundly Steve Jobs impacted the Valley - even down to Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s unblinking gaze and black turtleneck - and this generation of entrepreneurs. I remember having a similar feeling after reading David Reynolds\u2019\n\u00a0Empire of Liberty\n\u00a0and thinking to myself, wow, this is why the East Coast is the way it is, why New York and New Jersey\u2019s deep water harbors made them more metropolitan, why they are more accepting of immigrants, why there are more colleges north of the Mason-Dixon Line. I understand why so many Stanford freshmen read this book now. Next up,\u00a0\nZero to One\n.\u00a0\n"}
{"title": "Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz", "contents": "William Deresiewicz\u2019s\u00a0\nExcellent Sheep\n\u00a0is a powerful indictment of elite education in America, in particular the entitlement, credentialism, and lack of dissent impulse amongst elite students.\nDeresiewicz compares students at HYPS+ to \"excellent sheep\u201d - ambitious students who are trapped in an endless of cycle of hoop-jumping, from prep school to Ivy League to Goldman Sachs, often \"with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to Deresiewicz, here are the biggest problems with elite education:\n1) When students do get where they want to be,\u00a0\nthey have no idea why they are there\n\u00a0and are afraid to deviate from the status quo (finance, consulting, tech).\u00a0\n2) Students are\u00a0\ncloistered and lack diversity\n\u00a0- there's a huge financial cost to building a resum\u00e9 that elite schools want, and affluent families game the system with SAT tutors, donations, college essay advisors, etc.; kids lose out before the race has even started. However, this also means elite graduates struggle with connecting with people who are different than them.\nI didn\u2019t agree with everything in this book, especially Deresiewicz\u2019s critique of MOOCs - I think MOOCs are a powerful tool for democratizing education. That said, I think this book would be a valuable read for any high school or college student.The irony of this book and books like Frank Bruni\u2019s Where You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be is that reading them will get you into top schools, because colleges want students with this degree of awareness. In fact, there\u2019s a fantastic section towards the end of book about what a liberal arts education is and why it\u2019s valuable (wink wink, if you\u2019re applying to any Ivy/Williams/Amherst/Midd). Any student who reads this book will emerge with clearer goals. Excellent Sheep definitely encouraged me to become more critical and to redefine what I want to get out of college\n"}
